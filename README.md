# PTC-GUI
PTC, or Photo to Color Palette, is a program which takes a photo as input and generates color palettes based on different algorithms. This is a Java GUI to use the Photo to Color Palette.
## Process
- I learned through making this GUI a lot about Java swing as well as GUI's in general.
- I learned how to create, customize, and open a Window in Java
- I learned how to integrate a program in the backend of a GUI with the PhotoToColorPalette.java program running the magic behind the scenes
- I learned many parts of Java swing, including Components like JPanel, JButton, JFormattedTextField, and more. I also learned how to efficiently design a layout for my   JPanels and JFrames.
## ⚠️This GUI is not yet complete.⚠️
- While there are some provided images to use, I have yet to implement a way to use images from your computer as of 4/18/23
- There is still a lot more I want to do and eventually turn it into an executable standalone.
- The color palette generator algorithm can be greatly worked on as well, in order to speed it up as well as make it more accurate.
## My inspiration
Ever since getting Spotify Premium a couple years back, I've been hooked onto music, racking up 76,000 total hours streamed just last year alone. With my great variety of music I listen to with different vibes, moods, and emotions, I like to create many many different playlists. Until now, I didn't have a great idea of what to put as the icon images of my playlists, but then I had the brilliant idea to extract the default playlist icon's colors and use it as the image icon. Thus was born the Photo-To-Color-Palette idea.
